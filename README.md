# 👋 Hi, I’m **Paul Sattaur (PStar1980)**  
### Full-Stack Developer | AI-Driven Automation Architect | Builder of the Sky Ecosystem  

---

### ☁️ About Me  
I design and build intelligent systems that blend automation, orchestration, and evolution through code.  
My focus is on creating scalable, self-correcting architectures — where every commit is an act of refinement and every line of code moves closer to elegance.

> “Automation should be invisible — not loud, not fragile — but graceful and alive beneath every line of code.”
